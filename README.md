# paintCaclulator
Website allows the user to choose a paint color and auto populates the price of the paint. Then requires input for the square feet of space and will calculate the cost of the job.

This was a class project where I was required to develop the paint calculator function in PHP and allowed to add any design flair or enhanced functionality I wished. I chose to add the ability to click on a color to add the price to price textbox and all design choices were mine.
